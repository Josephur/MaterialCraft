# NODES.md: Substance 3D Designer node properties vs MaterialCraft

Research only, no code changed. For every MaterialCraft node type this lists the properties Adobe documents for the matching Substance 3D Designer node, what our Properties panel offers today, and what is missing.

## How this was made, and its limits
- Source: Adobe's official node reference (experienceleague.adobe.com, formerly helpx.adobe.com), one page per node, fetched through a summarising reader. Names, ranges and option lists are reliable. Wording is paraphrased.
- **Adobe's pages almost never state defaults or data types.** Where a range is given it is shown, otherwise `n/s` (not stated). Defaults still have to be checked in Designer itself.
- Screenshots could not be read, so anything only visible in the UI (property order, grouping, slider soft limits) is unconfirmed.
- Some pages were missing or ambiguous. Those cases are listed per node and in the "Not in Designer / not found" section.
- "Ours" lists the labels in our Properties panel today (`src/gui_params.rs`). Every node also has our per-node Output Size.

## Implementation status (updated Oct 2026)
The sections below are the research snapshot. Items marked here are **done in code**; everything else listed below is still open. New properties default to the old behaviour, so existing `.mcg` graphs render the same.

**Phase 1 (done):** Invert toggle · Threshold Mode (greater / greater or equal / lower / lower or equal) · Clamp Apply to alpha · Blend: Add sub and Switch modes, Alpha blending (4 modes), Cropping area · Mirror: Mode (axis X / Y / both / corner), axis offsets, invert axis, corner type · Symmetry: diagonal right, eight-fold, Transfer mode · Skew Align · Normal: Fill alpha with input · Normal Blend: Opacity + Mask input · Normal Combine Technique · Normal Invert blue/alpha · Normal Vector Rotation: Normal format + Rotation map input · Normal to Height: Relief balance, Global opacity · Vector Warp format · Multi Directional Warp: Directions 1/2/4 and Mode (average / max / min / chain) · Directional Warp: Intensity map offset + Input filtering · Warp: Input filtering · Glow: Clear amount + colour · Shape Glow / Shape Stroke: Opacity, Spread (glow), colour · Shape Drop Shadow: Spread · Bevel: Corner type + Normal format · Make It Tile Photo: separate H/V mask size.

**Phase 2 (done):** the shared noise block (Disorder speed, Disorder anisotropy + angle, Tile offset X/Y) on Perlin, Clouds, Fractal Noise, Gaussian Noise, BnW Spots, Gaussian Spots, Directional Noise and Cells (Fractal Sum and Waveform: Disorder + speed); White Noise: Noise distribution.

**Phase 3 (done):** Tile Sampler, Tile Generator, Splatter and Splatter Circular rebuilt in `src/scatter.rs`. All of Designer's 15 built-in patterns plus Pattern Specific (and random), up to six pattern inputs with Random / By pattern number / By ring number distribution, Pattern rotation 0/90/180/270, Symmetry random, Size mode (normal / keep ratio / absolute), Size Y/X ratio, Scale (+random, seed), Offset type (odd / even rows or columns), Offset random (+seed), Global offset, Position random X/Y, Luminance by number / by scale, Mask map invert, Random mask, Checker / Horizontal / Vertical mask, Invert mask, Blending (Max / Add / Alpha blend / Add-Sub), Global opacity, Background colour or input, Reverse rendering order, map inputs (Scale, Rotation, Displacement, Color, Distribution, Background, Mask) with multipliers. Splatter: Grid number + Disorder, Rotation, Pan X/Y, Gain, Output min/max, pattern aspect, blending, background. Splatter Circular: ring amount, ring radius multiplier, amount random (+min), radius random, angle random, spiral factor, spread, scale by pattern / ring number (+invert), centre orientation, ring rotation (+random, offset), colour, luminance random / by number / by ring, random mask, blending, background. Not done: Non-square expansion, Pixel size mode, Vector map inputs, Quincunx flip, Pattern Input Filtering, Pivot options, Splatter Zoom / Disorder angle, Connect patterns, Colour (RGB) versions of the nodes.

**Honest limits.** Adobe documents what each property is called and its range, but not the formulas. Where a formula is undocumented the behaviour is our interpretation, not a numerical match: Relief balance, Normal Combine "channel mixer" and "whiteout", Spread (glow/shadow), Pattern Specific, Horizontal / Vertical mask and the shapes of the built-in patterns (Thorn, Waves, Ridged Bell, Crescent, Capsule), Disorder / anisotropy (a smooth displacement field), Tile offset (whole part = another tile of the plane, fraction = pan), Directions for Multi Directional Warp. Matching Designer pixel for pixel needs side-by-side renders from Designer. **Not done on purpose:** Non-square expansion (we have no non-square graphs yet), Sharpen "Punchthrough alpha" (our Sharpen already leaves alpha untouched), Output Format / Pixel ratio / Tiling mode base parameters.

## 0. Common to (almost) every Designer node: Base parameters
| Designer | Ours |
|---|---|
| Output Size (Absolute / Relative to Parent / Relative to Input, power-of-two modifier -12..+12, width/height lock) | Yes (Relative to Input / Relative to Parent / Absolute, -12..+12). No width/height lock, square only |
| Output Format (8 bit, 16 bit float, 32 bit float; per node or inherited) | **Missing** (engine is f32, only graph-level export depth) |
| Pixel Size, Pixel Ratio | **Missing** |
| Tiling Mode (None / Horizontal / Vertical / Both; matters for Transformation 2D etc.) | **Missing** (we always tile) |
| Random Seed (inheritable, "new random value" button) | Partly: each random node has its own `seed` |
| Inheritance dropdown per base parameter | Output Size only |

## 0b. Common "noise" block (most Designer noises and spots)
Scale (int) | Disorder (float) | Disorder speed | Disorder anisotropy | Disorder anisotropy angle | Tile offset (float2) | Non-square expansion (bool).

## 7. SDF nodes
Designer has **no compositing nodes** called SDF Primitive 2D/3D, SDF Boolean, SDF to Mask or Extrude. SDF in Designer is (a) a family of **function-graph** nodes (primitives, operators Union / Intersection / Subtraction, morphs, shell, symmetries, transforms, material set) used by Shape Splatter v2 and the 3D viewer, and (b) the compositing node **3D Texture SDF** (input Mask Input; Threshold; Output: Distance Field / Signed Distance Field). Our sdf_shape, sdf_op, sdf_mask, sdf_form are therefore our own design:
- sdf_shape: Shape, Size, Aspect, Sides, Rotation, Corner rounding, Position X/Y, Distance range
- sdf_op: Operation, Smoothing, Distance range
- sdf_mask: Offset, Edge softness
- sdf_form: Shape, Size, Repeat, Rounding, Size variation, Height, seed
Action: keep, and add function-graph SDF later.

- No documentation page found: Fractal Noise, Star 1/2, Checker 2, Tile Brick, Lines, Gradient Angular, Waveform 2/3 (not checked), Flood Fill to Random Grayscale (page empty), Input Color (fetch failed).
- Page-to-variant mapping unverified: Cells 1/2/3, Crystal 1/2 ranges.

## 10. Summary and suggested order

**Nodes whose properties are already complete or nearly so (about 20):** blur, blur_hq, directional_blur, slope_blur, highpass, histogram_scan, histogram_range, histogram_shift, pow, hsl, channel_mixer, replace_color, auto_levels, chrominance_extract, normal_normalize, merge, alpha_merge, multi_directional_warp (minus Mode), vector_warp (minus Format), anisotropic_blur (minus Quality).

**Cheap wins (one or two missing properties, no new engine work):** invert toggle, threshold Mode, clamp Apply to Alpha, blend Add Sub + Alpha blending + Cropping area, levels Intermediary clamp, normal_invert Blue/Alpha, normal Alpha channel content, normal_combine Technique, normal_blend Opacity/mask, normal_vector_rotation Normal Format, normal_to_height Relief Balance/Global Opacity, vector_warp Format, multi_directional_warp Mode, directional_warp filtering/offset, warp filtering, sharpen Punchthrough Alpha, mirror offsets/invert/corner, symmetry modes + Transfer Mode, skew Axis/Amount/Align, glow Clear Amount, shape glow/stroke/shadow Spread/Opacity/Colour, bevel Corner Type/Normal Format, make_it_tile_photo six H/V sliders, non-uniform blur extras.

**Common block, touches ~25 noise nodes:** Disorder speed, Disorder anisotropy (+angle), Tile offset, Non-square expansion, plus Non-square expansion on every pattern.

**Larger rebuilds (new behaviour):** Tile Sampler (~45 properties, 7 map inputs), Tile Generator (~35), Splatter / Splatter Circular (~40), Voronoi + Voronoi Fractal, Triangle Grid, Grunge Map 001-015 and the Advanced grunge nodes, Cells 1-4 per-variant parameters, Shape pattern list (Bell, Thorn, Brick, Gradation, Waves, Ridged Bell, Crescent, Capsule), Polygon 1/2, Weave Generator, Edge Detect, Mosaic and Radial Blur (behaviour differs from Designer), Gradient Map editor (addressing, interpolation modes, more keys), Quantize Color, Color Match, Ambient Occlusion (RTAO + world units).

**Needs engine features first:** multi-output nodes (Bevel, Curvature Smooth, Quantize, Height Blend), second image inputs (Distance Source, Color to Mask, Channels Shuffle, Normal Vector Rotation map, Emboss height, Non-uniform blur map exists), function graphs (Pixel Processor, Waveform custom function), baked mesh inputs (Dirt, Dust, Edge Wear, Metal Edge Wear, Weathering), per-node Output Format / Tiling Mode / Pixel Ratio.
