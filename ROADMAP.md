# MaterialCraft Roadmap

MaterialCraft is a node-based procedural material editor written in pure Rust (Windows, Linux, macOS). The core library has zero dependencies; only the GUI binary uses eframe + rfd. File formats: `.mcg` (editable graph), `.mca` (published package).

Status note: everything has been built and tested on Linux only (CI for Windows, Linux and macOS is set up in `.github/workflows/ci.yml` but has not run yet). The GPU viewport has been verified on Mesa llvmpipe only, not on real GPUs.

- Output (11 usages: basecolor, normal, roughness, metallic, height, ambient_occlusion, opacity, emissive, diffuse, specular, glossiness)
- Input (for subgraphs), Subgraph, Dot (link re-route)
- Comment, Frame

### Editor and workflow
- Packages workspace: any number of packages open at once, shown in the Explorer as roots (icon, italic bold name, `*` when modified) with their graphs underneath; each graph expands to list its outputs. File > New > Material Graph (Ctrl+N) adds a graph to the selected package; File > New > Empty Package creates a new unsaved package (preset chooser with graph name); File > Open adds packages without closing others. Right-click empty Explorer space: New Package / New Material Graph / Open Package(s); right-click a package: New > Material Graph, Save Package, Close Package (asks when unsaved). Graphs from any open package can be dragged onto the canvas to become nodes
- Graph nodes have one labelled output socket per output (Base Color, Normal, Roughness, ...); links remember which output they read (`in=@3.height` in the file format), sockets with links are filled orange
- Graphs as nodes: any saved graph (`.mcg`/`.mca`) can be dragged from the Explorer onto the canvas, dropped from the OS onto the window; it becomes a subgraph node (input sockets only appear if the graph defines inputs) whose exposed parameters and chosen output work like any node, so complex materials can be built from simpler ones
- Node graph with zoom, pan, rubber-band select, drag-to-connect from either end, cycle protection
- Tab search with auto-connect, undo/redo (100 steps), copy/paste (also via OS clipboard), duplicate, auto-layout
- Subgraph creation and editing, multiple graphs, exposed parameters
- Per-node property panels with color wheel and gradient editor
- Home screen with recent files, New Graph dialog, node library with thumbnails
- Resizable 2D and 3D views

### 3D viewport (GPU, OpenGL 3.3 via egui_glow)
- 13 preview objects: Cube, Cylinder, Hollow box, Inner box (seen from inside), Plane, Plane (hi-res), Sphere, Cloth, Mat ball, Rounded cube, Rounded cylinder, Sphere 2 tiles, Torus (mesh resolution up to 768 x 768; all closed shapes stay crack-free when displaced)
- True outward displacement, plus parallax relief and bump modes
- GGX PBR, mipmaps with anisotropic filtering, 4x MSAA (falls back to none), contact shadows, hue-preserving filmic tone mapping (bright oranges no longer wash out to pink), horizon-occluded reflections
- Light, camera, exposure and ambient controls, UV tiling, wireframe, normal strength; the key light follows the camera by default (Lights > Light follows the camera), a soft fill light keeps shadowed sides readable
- Studio reflection environment (softboxes, rim strip, horizon) that blurs with roughness, so roughness and metallic changes read clearly
- CPU renderer as automatic fallback (Renderer menu)
- Headless test: `cargo run --release --features gui --example gpu_shot -- out.png [shape] [relief] [w h] [nomsaa] [wire]`

### Export, files and tools
- Export to PNG, JPEG, TIFF at 8 or 16 bit
- Several resolutions at once (256 to 8192 px) and per-output selection
- `.mcg` editable graphs, `.mca` published packages with exposed parameters
- Mesh baking from OBJ (BVH): normal, world normal, AO, curvature, thickness, position, ID
- CLI: render, publish, params, bake

### Quality and resolution
- Graph size 128 to 8192 px; the editor previews at the graph's own size (2048 px by default for a 2K graph, capped at 4096 for the preview), shows a quick 256 px pass first and refines in the background. All parameters are resolution independent (checked by a test)
- Every node tiles seamlessly: centred shapes and gradients wrap around the tile border, checker/weave use even counts, flood fill regions that cross the border keep one continuous gradient, Transform 2D cross-fades only when the matrix cannot tile by itself. `tests/seam.rs` renders every node and 100+ parameter variants and fails on any visible seam
- Anti-aliased hard edges (shapes, checker, bricks), bicubic resampling in Transform/Warp, Scharr-filter normals, fast gaussian blur (cost independent of radius, multi-threaded), 4096-entry gradient table for noise, rotated fractal octaves (no visible grid), spots as a union of discs (no cell-edge cuts)
- 2D view shows true texels like Designer: crisp squares when zoomed in, mip-mapped when zoomed out. The shipped example graph is 2048 px. Maps above 4096 px are box-averaged (not point-sampled) when they go to the 3D viewport
- Per-node Output Size like Designer: every node has Relative to Input (default), Relative to Parent or Absolute (16-8192 px), plus a -12..+12 power-of-two modifier. Inputs of another size are resampled automatically, so heavy nodes (AO, blurs, noises) can run at half or quarter resolution. Nodes with their own size show it under the card
- Node result cache (Designer-style): the editor keeps every node's result between evaluations, found by a hash of its settings, the evaluation size and the hashes of its inputs. An edit recomputes only the edited node and what is downstream of it; thumbnails and unchanged outputs come straight from the cache. Least-recently-used entries are dropped above a memory budget (3 GB, set `MC_CACHE_MB` to change), and grayscale results are stored with one channel. On the 2048 brick example (2 cores) editing the normal strength went from about 4.5 s to about 0.35 s; `cargo run --release --example cache_bench -- graph.mcg 2048 <node> <param> <v1> <v2>` measures it
- The node shown in the 2D view is evaluated first and put on screen as soon as it is done, before the outputs, the 3D maps and the other thumbnails
- Faster kernels (cold run of the 2048 brick example: 3.9 s to about 1.4 s on 2 cores): Fractal Noise builds its gradient lattices once (about 1.8x faster, identical values); grayscale blurs run on one channel and the vertical pass needs no transpose (Ambient Occlusion about 4x faster); Normal From Height, Levels and Blend run on all cores (Normal about 6x, Levels about 4x faster); Slope Blur uses grayscale planes; Directional Noise samples the streak less densely (2x faster, mean difference below 0.01); bilinear and bicubic sampling skip the wrap arithmetic inside the image; the editor shares the kept output textures instead of copying them
- Responsive previews: editing cancels the running evaluation (it stops within a few rows, even inside a heavy node) and starts the new one immediately; previews are progressive (256, 512, 1024 ... up to the preview size) so a change shows in a fraction of a second; the 2D image and GPU textures are prepared on the worker thread, so the editor never stalls; switching or entering a graph clears the old previews at once
- Memory: intermediate textures are freed as soon as every node that reads them has finished, so large graphs at 4K fit

### Quality checks
- 57 automated tests, including: a wrap-around check that rolls the input of 30 filters and requires the output to roll identically (proves every filter wraps at the borders), seam checks on every node, every node at four resolutions (finite, sane range, not blank), every documented parameter fuzzed with extreme values (no panics/NaN), and whole-graph import and per-output links
- `cargo run --release --example node_sheet -- out_dir` renders a PNG for every node type for visual review

## 2b. Designer feature gap (checked against Adobe's node library and release notes, Oct 2026)

We have 121 node types; Designer's library has roughly 500. Missing, by area:

**Property parity:** `NODES.md` lists, for each of our 121 nodes, the properties Designer documents, what our Properties panel has and what is missing. Done so far: the cheap one-property gaps (Phase 1) the shared noise block (Disorder speed / anisotropy, Tile offset; Phase 2) and the Tile Sampler / Tile Generator / Splatter / Splatter Circular rebuilds (Phase 3: built-in patterns, six inputs, offsets, masks, blending, map inputs, rings) and the four nodes that behaved differently (Phase 4: Radial Blur spin, Edge Detect lines, Mosaic map, Curvature from normal maps) and Voronoi / Voronoi Fractal / Cells / Grunge properties (Phase 5), see its status section. Still open: the other large rebuilds (Grunge Map 001-015 images, Triangle Grid, Gradient Map editor, Color Match, Quantize Color, RTAO / world-unit AO), and the properties that need engine features (multi-output nodes, extra image inputs, function graphs, baked mesh inputs).

## 3. Suggested order

1. Function graphs + FX-Map (unlocks the most missing nodes)
2. Spline / path tools
3. HDRI image-based lighting and custom mesh loading
4. More nodes and a built-in material library
5. Color management, EXR/JPEG/TIFF import, HDR export
6. Scripting/batch API and engine output templates
